A Mero Hajur 2(2017),"PLOT ""A Mero Hajur 2"" (Nepali: ए मेरो हजुर २) is a 2017 Nepali musical romance directed by Jharana Thapa.[2][3] The sequel to the A Mero Hajur series features Samragyee RL Shah and debutant Salin Man Baniya in lead roles. While the movie garnered mixed to negative reviews from critics, it received acclaim for its music. However, the performances, direction, familiar storyline, and screenplay faced criticism. Despite the mixed reception, the film had an impressive opening weekend at the box office, ultimately becoming a massive success. Its triumph was attributed to the popularity of its predecessor, starring Shree Krishna Shrestha and Jharana Thapa, as well as the music. Additionally, the film spawned two more sequels.","Salin Man BaniyaPrem, Samragyee RL ShahMaya, Salon BasnetJay, Buddhi TamangDriver, Anurag KunwarMaya's Brother, Amber Subedi, Ajashra Dhungana, Lokesh OliPrem's Father, Suman Poudel, Prakash Shrestha, Anubhav Regmi, Asin Crystal RL Rana, Wilson Bikram RaiRamananda (Artist)","Drama,Romance",2h 40m,Jharana Thapa,Suhana Entertainment,"16 Bhadra, 2074, 1 September, 2017",https://img.youtube.com/vi/tcodrIK2P_I/hqdefault.jpg,,,https://www.thefilmnepal.com/movie/a-mero-hajur-2

When Bikram lacks the means to educate himself, Bir tries to assist him. However, they part ways at the age of six. Before parting, Bir gives Bikram a one-rupee coin inscribed with ""Bir Bikram"". Subsequently, Bir becomes a country boy (farmer), while Bikram pursues education and becomes a teacher in Kathmandu. Eventually, Bikram returns to the village, but neither recognizes the other. However, Bikram endeavors to unite Bir with a girlfriend whom Bir adores. Joon (Deeya Pun) and Bir (Dayahang Rai) love each other, but Bir refrains from expressing his feelings to Joon due to his promise to Bikram to keep her safe. Bikram, who left Joon when she was young, returns to the village and orchestrates events to bring Joon and Bir together, even if it means appearing as a villain to Bir. Eventually, Bikram succeeds in uniting them. Aaitey (Arpan Thapa), the wealthiest man in the village, is enamored with Joon, but she does not reciprocate his feelings. Aaitey earns a substantial sum by constructing a road in the village, garnering respect and wealth.

Aaitey offers a large sum and promises Joon a lavish life. However, she chooses to flee with Bir.

Maiyya, a student of high school, on the other hand, is peeved by his idiotic behaviors. This rejection from Maiyya always disappoints Kazi but never disheartens him. Supported by his two childhood friends Beekay and Chantyal, he finally decides to marry Maiyya through capture marriage, which is illegal but still practiced by some ethnic communities in Mustang. To find her long-gone father and to continue her studies in Kathmandu, Maiyya elopes with a visitor named ‘Bibek’. Inflamed by her disappearance, Kazi heads to Kathmandu in search of Maiyya and finds himself trapped in a city conspiracy. Bibek turns out to be a broken man trying to take revenge against Maiyya's father.

Each of us desire love, and each of us desire a specific kind of love and a specific way of illuminating our lives through it. Abhi, Ashna, Prayash and Dibya are similarly in search of a special kind of love. Ashna and Prayash, two friends who have known each other forever, are separated by circumstance from Abhi, their mischievous but poetic friend who chooses ambition over friendship. Years later, at a fateful time in their lives, he realizes that he has to choose again, between keeping his friendship and going after the love of his life. Similarly, Ashna faces the choice between being true to herself and doing right by her family and society. Love demands sacrifice, they all learn: the bigger the sacrifice, the sweeter the reward, sometimes as freedom, and sometimes as the knowledge that the person you love has gained everything you'd wish for them. ""Kohi Mero"" is a story about the search for that special person and the special sacrifice it takes for us to show our love for each other.","Aaryan SigdelAbhi, Subash ThapaPrayash, Sanchita LuitelAasna, Jharana BajracharyaDibya, Dinesh SharmaKunwar, Tripti NadakarAbhi's Mother, Radha LamsalAasna's Fupu","Adventure,Romance",2h 6m,Aalok Nembang,Movies.com Films,"11 Bhadra, 2067, 27 August, 2010",https://img.youtube.com/vi/n52K_sODtNM/hqdefault.jpg,,,https://www.thefilmnepal.com/movie/kohi-mero

Kaha Bhetiyela(2008),"PLOT “Kaha Bhetiyela” (2008), directed by Shiva Regmi, is a captivating Nepali drama that unfolds against the backdrop of a newly built road in the remote eastern Himalayas of Nepal. Abhishek, a young traveler, stops at a highway restaurant and encounters Muna, a talented dancer. Their paths intersect, and love blossoms between them. However, their romance faces an unexpected challenge: a group of goons who are determined to prevent Muna from escaping their oppression. Abhishek and Muna embark on a daring journey, attempting to break free from the clutches of these menacing figures. As the road winds through the rugged terrain, their bond deepens, and they must navigate not only physical obstacles but also the emotional complexities of their situation. The film beautifully captures the tension between tradition and progress, love and adversity, as Abhishek and Muna fight for their freedom and happiness.","Shree Krishna ShresthaAbhishek, Shweta KhadkaMuna, Mithila Sharma, Sushila Rayamajhi, Rabi Giri, Birendra Hamal, Neer Bikram Shah, R.P.

Muna Madan(2003),"PLOT The movie describes the life of a man (Madan) who leaves his wife (Muna) and goes to Lhasa to make money. Madan represents all the youths of Nepal who go abroad to earn money to earn their living. The wife of Madan, Muna is the queen of love and sacrifice. She loves her Madan a lot so she is upset as she has to send him to a place, Lhasa, where there are lots of obstacles and risks. But finally, she accepts this challenge and stays in the country with her mother-in-law who is old and weak. While returning home, Madan becomes sick on the way. His friends leave him on the road and come back home saying he has died. Finally, he is rescued by a man who is considered to be of a lower caste in Nepal. That is why it is said that a man is said to be great not by caste or race but by a heart full of love and humanity. When Madan returns to Kathmandu after regaining his health, he discovers that his mother and his beloved wife had already died. Madan comes to realize that money is of no value at that point.","Deepak TripathiMadan, Usha PoudelMuna, Mithila SharmaMadan's Sister, Dinesh D.C.Kaji, Neer Bikram Shah, Subhadra AdhikariMadan's Mother, Ramchandra Adhikari, Sangam Bhandari, Saru Baral, Vijay LamaChyangba, Shiva Hari PoudelMadan's Friend, Madan Man Bajracharya, Bhim Pokharel, Gajendra Tamrakar, Radha Lamsal","Drama,Romance,Family",2h 58m,Gyanendra Deuja,N.B.A. Chalchitra,"13 Asar, 2060, 27 June, 2003",https://img.youtube.com/vi/pCU20sjBvuQ/hqdefault.jpg,,,https://www.thefilmnepal.com/movie/muna-madan

Yo Mayako Sagar(2000),"PLOT Bishal (Ramesh Upreti) is a college student in Kathmandu. He is in love with Lily (Saranga Shrestha), but he is a playboy who does not take relationships seriously. He is restricted from his college due to his misbehavior. Prior to this, he had already been expelled from every other college in Kathmandu. His father, Bishwa Pratap (Harihar Sharma), sends him to the college in Pokhara. Bishal plans to get expelled somehow from the college in Pokhara so he can go back to Kathmandu. However, he sees Mala (Jal Shah) and falls in love with her at first sight. He decides to stay in the city. On the other hand, Abhayjan (Neer Shah), Mala's father, wants to get Mala married. But Mala asks him for some time, and she promises him that if she does not get a life partner for herself in that time, she will get married to whoever her father wants her to get married with. Consequently, Mala and Bishal fall in love and decide to get married. Bishal is on his way to meet Abhayjan, but on the way, Pitambar (Sunil Thapa) hires a truck driver to kill him, and in an attempt to save himself, Bishal accidentally crashes into Abhayjan. Abhayjan gets furious and insults Bishal in front of people, and Bishal also gets angry at Abhayjan, and he also insults him for his disabled leg. Later, when Bishal arrives at Mala's house, he realizes that Abhayjan is her father. He apologizes to him, but he does not accept it. After their parents decline their relationship, Mala and Bishal run away. They get married and live in Sagar's (Rajesh Hamal) house. There, we get to see the back story of Sagar's life. He used to be a police inspector, and his brother-in-law was a terrorist, but he accidentally killed his wife too when she tried to save her brother. Later, Mala and Bishal are captured by Pitambar. However, they fight back with the help of their family and manage to escape.

Chameli(2000),"PLOT Chameli was once a trusting fifteen year old Nepali girl from a remote village in the Himalayas. Like most girls her age, she often dreamt of someday marrying, starting a family, having children around the home, and living her life the way her family had for generations- to fulfill the destiny that was her birth right as a girl born to Nepal. But through a twist in fate, evil in the form of a man named Amar wandered into her village one day and after skillfully manipulating the situation to pay into his favor, within a week, Chameli and Amar became husband and wife. With promises of great riches and security for her entire family, the arrangements were swiftly made by Chameli's unsuspecting parents. As the newly weds left Chameli's village for Amar's home in the Terai, the mystery of the world which had always lay just beyond the hills was revealed to Chameli. Like a new born experiencing the universe for the first time, her expectations of a good life with a man she had come to love, grew by the hour. While his behavior was sometimes unusual to her, she had no way of knowing the extent of the evil which loomed within. Even after departing for Mumbai, Chameli never once suspected that the things were not as they should be. There are few things more disturbing in life which compare with Amar's ultimate betrayal of Chameli. In a small back room of Kamathipura, a notorious area of Mumbai, Chameli's ultimate fate was decided forever. She was sold like an animal to the owner of the brothel for a mere $200. After being delivered to the house and told to wait, the man she had married and had come to accept as her husband never returned. After being saved from the brothel after many years, Chameli finally reached her home in village Nepal where she was banished. The story reaches a peak near the end where Chameli meets up with her ""so-called"" husband and the full fury of the injustice she had suffered comes to the surface. The film was produced and directed by Ravi Baral.

Mukundo(1999),"PLOT The story unfolds in the heart of Kathmandu, where Dipak, a former army football player, works as a guard for a successful business, living contentedly with his loving wife Saraswati and their two young daughters in a modest apartment. Despite their happiness, their lives are marred by one unfulfilled desire: to have a son. As Saraswati's pregnancy brings hope, the anticipation of finally having a boy grows, but their joy is short-lived as the infant son dies. Desperation engulfs the family, and Saraswati's health deteriorates as she grapples with bouts of depression. A mysterious sadhu advises her to seek help from the jhankrini, a spirit medium of the Tripura goddess, as he believes the goddess can fulfill her wishes. In parallel, we discover the jhankrini, Gita, has a tumultuous history of her own. Married off to a mentally disturbed husband who eventually commits suicide, she becomes a medium after being diagnosed as ""possessed"" due to her emotional turmoil. Fate and desire converge to bring Dipak, Saraswati, and Gita together. Gita's treatment appears to work, and the three form a unique connection. Saraswati, grateful to Gita, becomes fascinated by the spirit medium, who in turn is touched by Dipak's innocence. However, Saraswati's depression, fueled by her complex emotions for Gita, threatens her sanity. She returns to the goddess, and in a moment of clarity, decides to return to Gita, not only for her own healing but also for her husband's well-being. On an important religious festival day, during a ritual cure, an unexpected incident unfolds. Gita and Saraswati engage in a violent struggle, each accusing the other of being bewitched. The frenzied devotees' drumbeats echo the ritual's frenzy. In the eerie aftermath of the festival, the true nature of the bewitching remains uncertain, leaving everyone disturbed and bewildered. The narrative delves into complex human desires, spiritual beliefs, and the enigmatic boundaries between reality and mysticism, painting a haunting portrait of intertwined lives in Kathmandu.","Mithila Sharma, Gauri Malla, Ratan Subedi, Rama Thapaliya, Dipika Dahal, Alika Dhakal, Nirmal Pyakurel","Religion,Drama",1h 40m,Chering Ritar Sherpa,N/A,"11 Kartik, 2056, 28 October, 1999",,,,https://www.thefilmnepal.com/movie/mukundo

Harishchandra(1951),"PLOT The history of cinema in Nepal traces its origins to the year 2008 (Bikram Era) when the first-ever Nepali feature film, titled ""Harishchandra,"" was produced in Kolkata, India. This landmark film was directed, produced, and written by D. B. Pariyar, and it was released on September 14, 1951.

If it is still available for viewing, I would greatly appreciate any suggestions on where it might be accessible for those interested in experiencing this historical cinematic work.","D.B.
